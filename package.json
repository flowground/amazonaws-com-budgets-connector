    "description": "The AWS Budgets API enables you to use AWS Budgets to plan your service usage,\nservice costs, and instance reservations. The API reference provides\ndescriptions, syntax, and usage examples for each of the actions and data types\nfor AWS Budgets. \n\nBudgets provide you with a way to see the following information:\n\n *  How close your plan is to your budgeted amount or to the free tier limits\n   \n   \n *  Your usage-to-date, including how much you've used of your Reserved\n   Instances (RIs)\n   \n   \n *  Your current estimated charges from AWS, and how much your predicted usage\n   will accrue in charges by the end of the month\n   \n   \n *  How much of your budget has been used\n   \n   \n\nAWS updates your budget status several times a day. Budgets track your unblended\ncosts, subscriptions, refunds, and RIs. You can create the following types of\nbudgets:\n\n *   Cost budgets - Plan how much you want to spend on a service.\n   \n   \n *   Usage budgets - Plan how much you want to use one or more services.\n   \n   \n *   RI utilization budgets - Define a utilization threshold, and receive alerts\n   when your RI usage falls below that threshold. This lets you see if your RIs\n   are unused or under-utilized.\n   \n   \n *   RI coverage budgets - Define a coverage threshold, and receive alerts when\n   the number of your instance hours that are covered by RIs fall below that\n   threshold. This lets you see how much of your instance usage is covered by a\n   reservation.\n   \n   \n\nService Endpoint\n\nThe AWS Budgets API provides the following endpoint:\n\n *  https://budgets.amazonaws.com\n   \n   \n\nFor information about costs that are associated with the AWS Budgets API, see \nAWS Cost Management Pricing\n[https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/pricing/].",
